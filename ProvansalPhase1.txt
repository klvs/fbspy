2. My main contribution to the project so far has been preparing the visualization code for the
optimized version of our Python script. Alex has been altering our data collection script so that
we can compress our csv further and in order to do this our D3 code needs to be changed to fit
with the script output. I have also been participating in all of the discussion about the design and
logistics of our visualization.
